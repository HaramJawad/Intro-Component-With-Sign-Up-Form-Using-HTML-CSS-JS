This is a simple intro component with a sign-up form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I made this project to practice form validation, DOM manipulation, and responsive layouts.

FEATURES:
Responsive layout
Form validation using JavaScript
Shows error messages for empty fields
Email format validation using regex
Error icons shown for invalid inputs
Password show/hide toggle
Success message on valid submission
Form submits without page reload

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML5
CSS3 (Flexbox & Media Queries)
Vanilla JavaScript
No libraries or frameworks were used.

WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT:
How to validate form inputs using JavaScript
How to work with regex for email validation
DOM selection and event handling
Showing and hiding elements dynamically
Handling form submission without reloading the page
Making layouts responsive using flexbox and media queries

HOW IT WORKS:
User fills in the form
JavaScript checks if fields are empty
Email is validated using a regex pattern
Errors are shown with messages and icons
If everything is valid, a success message is shown
Password visibility can be toggled using the eye icon
